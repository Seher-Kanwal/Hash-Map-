# Hash-Map-
Hash map implementation in python 
Hash maps are indexed data structures. A hash map uses a hash function to compute an index with a key/value into an array of buckets.
Its value is mapped to the bucket with the corresponding index. The key is unique just like a currency note and these keys are immutable.

### In Python, dictionaries are examples of hash maps.

# The search complexity of a hash map is O(1).

# Working
* It takes key as an argument
* Than convert each char of the key into the ASCII Code and sum them all
* As we know that it's a bucket of the array, so we take modulusof  sum with the length of the bucket
* Result of the modulus is our hash known as index on which we store our value corresponding to that key

## Chaining

 ã€€ basic idea of this method is to form a single linked list of all addresses hash synonym chain is called the element i, 
   a single list head pointer and the i-th unit is present in the hash table, thereby find, insert and delete mainly in 
   the synonym chain. Chain address law applicable to the case of frequent insertions and deletions.

## Linear Probing
   In case of same index, we try to find the next empty space for implementing the value, but if are at the last index, 
   than we move towards the start of the array  of list to put our value
